"""
namedtuple() : The factory function

    Are immutable data structures
    Have a consistent hash value
    Can work as dictionary keys
    Can be stored in sets
    Have a helpful docstring based on the type and field names
    Provide a helpful string representation that prints the tuple content in a name=value format
    Support indexing
    Provide additional methods and attributes, such as ._make(), _asdict(), ._fields, and so on
    Are backward compatible with regular tuples
    Have similar memory consumption to regular tuples

In general, you can use namedtuple instances wherever you need a tuple-like object. Named tuples have the advantage that they provide a way to access their values using field names and the dot notation.

"""
To create a new namedtuple, you need to provide two positional arguments to the function:

    typename provides the class name for the namedtuple returned by namedtuple(). You need to pass a string with a valid Python identifier to this argument.
    field_names provides the field names that youâ€™ll use to access the values in the tuple. You can provide the field names using:
        An iterable of strings, such as ["field1", "field2", ..., "fieldN"]
        A string with each field name separated by whitespace, such as "field1 field2 ... fieldN"
        A string with each field name separated by commas, such as "field1, field2, ..., fieldN"
